### leveraging dbt and Python for modeling pipelines

To use the `main.py` script, follow these steps:

* Ensure that you have all the required Python scripts (`fetch_and_write_data.py`, `dbt_transform_data.py`, `run_scoring.py`) in the same directory as the `main.py` script.

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` script is located.

* Run the `main.py` script using the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```

The `main.py` script will execute the three steps in sequence:

* Fetch and Write Data: The `fetch_and_write_data.run()` function will be called to fetch external data and store it in the Postgres database.

* Transform Data with dbt: The `dbt_transform_data.run()` function will be called to perform data transformations using dbt.

* *Run Scoring Model: The `run_scoring.run()` function will be called to load the pre-trained scoring model, perform predictions, and save the results to the database.

After completing all the steps, the script will print "Entire process completed successfully âœ“" along with the total time taken for the entire process.

**Note:** Before running the `main.py` script, make sure you have set up the Postgres database and dbt project as described in the previous scripts. Additionally, ensure that you have installed all the required Python packages mentioned in the scripts.
